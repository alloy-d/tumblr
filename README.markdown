What is this?
=============

This is a repository of the themes I've created for
[Tumblr](http://tumblr.com)-powered blogs.

You can find my tumblelog, which is quite probably using one of these
themes, [here](http://calcandcoffee.tumblr.com).



The themes
==========

Hash
----

My first Tumblr theme. It was created from scratch with the intent of being
both simple and attractive. You may think it fits both criteria nicely, or
you may feel that it's a terrible atrocity.

If you'd like to see it in action, you can check out [a sample tumblelog
using it](http://hashtheme.tumblr.com/).


I like lampposts.
-----------------

A work in progress. It is currently mostly complete, but it is obviously
not polished in several places. If you'd like to see what it looks like so
far, [you can](http://ilikelampposts.tumblr.com/).


Light City
----------

A light theme designed to be elegant and minimal. I've created [a sample
tumblelog that uses it](http://lightcitytheme.tumblr.com/).
