What is this?
=============

This is a repository of the themes I've created for
[Tumblr](http://tumblr.com)-powered blogs.

You can find my tumblelog, which is quite probably using one of these
themes, [here](http://text.alloy-d.net).



The themes
==========

[Hash](tip/hash/theme.html)
------------------------------

My first Tumblr theme. It was created from scratch with the intent of being
both simple and attractive. You may think it fits both criteria nicely, or
you may feel that it's a terrible atrocity.

If you'd like to see it in action, you can check out [a sample tumblelog
using it](http://hashtheme.tumblr.com/).


[I like lampposts.](tip/ilikelampposts/theme.html)
-----------------------------------------------------

A work in progress. It is currently mostly complete, but it is obviously
not polished in several places. If you'd like to see what it looks like so
far, [you can](http://ilikelampposts.tumblr.com/).

(I refer to this theme as 'illp' in my commit messages.)


[Light City](tip/lightcity/theme.html)
-----------------------------------------

A light theme designed to be elegant and minimal. I've created [a sample
tumblelog that uses it](http://lightcitytheme.tumblr.com/).

(I refer to this theme as 'lc' in my commit messages, and it started out as
'wc'.)


[Smile!](tip/smile/theme.html)
------------------------------

A cheerful and minimalistic theme.  It uses Tumblr's new theming features
to be very customizable (and largely internationalizable).  You can see it
in action [here](http://smiletheme.tumblr.com/).

(This is, not surprisingly, referred to as 'smile' in my commit messages.)


Other
-----

You can find a theme I made for personal use in the
[adamlloyd](master/adamlloyd) directory. <del>As of the last edit of
this README, it is in use on [my main
tumblelog](http://text.alloy-d.net).</del> <ins>I'm not enough of a
peacock to carry it off, though, so it's no longer in use.</ins> (This
is referred to as 'al' in my commit messages.)

The file [base.html](tip/base.html) contains, more or less, the HTML that
is used by each of my themes since "I like lampposts". More up-to-date
copies can probably be extracted from either my personal theme or
Light City.
